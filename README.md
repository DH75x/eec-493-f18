## FAQ(s):

  Q: Does the program grab affiliations?

  A: Yes, if the article's host website has a supported parser the program will attempt to parse for the author affiliations  (institution and email if applicable). The three websites that are supported at the moment are https://www.asme.org/, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/, and https://www.springer.com/us. If a website doesn't have a supported parser that means the website has incompatible HTML code that can be parsed in a trivial matter.
