## Other Recommendations:

  For the best results, go to an article's webpage directly and retrieve the citation file (.bib or .ris). Here are some examples of how to export the citation off a website. Most websites will have some system like the ones listed below.

  By doing this, the program has an easier time checking for affiliations.
  
## FAQs:

  Q: Does the program grab affiliations?

  A: Yes, if the article's host website has a supported parser the program will attempt to parse for the author affiliations  (institution and email if applicable). The three websites that are supported at the moment are https://www.asme.org/, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/, and https://www.springer.com/us. If a website doesn't have a supported parser that means the website has incompatible HTML code that can't be parsed in a trivial matter.
  
  Q: The output excel file is a .csv, will that cause issues?
  
  A: No, you can use it as a normal excel file. .csv stands for comma separated values and it's how the program creates the excel spreadsheet from within the program. If you want to convert it over to another excel format such as .xlsx, just open the .csv file that was just created and save it as any type of excel filetype you want.
  
  Q: Can the folder that contains the citation files include both .bib and .ris files?
  
  A: Yes, put as many .bib and .ris files in the folder as you want. Very large amounts, like thousands, may take a while to execute through, but it will do the job.
